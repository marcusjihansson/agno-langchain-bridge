# My custom tools 

I have here decided to upload my custom tools, which I have used for this project and for use with Agno-agi models.

Something to note is that this file contains more tools, than existing langchain classes, but I am in the near future going to upload these classes 
so that these tools would be more applicable. 

For the time being please use these tools with the existing classes and use this format when building your own Agents with this Langchain bridge.
