    "\n",
    "### Overview  \n",
    "- This project explores how to supercharge Agno-agi Agents, by giving these Agents Langchain functionalities to complete automated advanced tasks more efficiently. \n",
    "- Building intelligent AI agents requires seamless interactions between large language models and external tools. This project helps aiding that process by exploring a bridge between two open source projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters  \n",
    "- For AI leaders: This demonstrates how Langchain can streamline AI development, improving productivity and decision-making. Without sacrificing the visually pleasing and easily deployed Agents from Agno-agi. \n",
    "- For engineers: It provides a structured approach to integrating AI agents efficiently. Now with more tools and more functionalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Highlights**\n",
    "- Uses Langchain to integrate AI models with real-world applications.  \n",
    "- Implements structured pipelines for building a Langchain class (Python class with Langchain ChatPromptTemplate and LLM) and then transforming this into an Agno-agi tool.\n",
    "- Designed with **modularity** and **scalability** in mind, and my implementation would be ideal for companies who need to do more data transformations before running the Agent.\n",
    "\n",

    "Whether you're a **manager exploring AI applications** or a **developer working on AGI projects**, this notebook serves as a **practical bridge** to more advanced AI agent architectures.\n"

    "\n",
    "- LangChain and Agno-agi adopt fundamentally different approaches to leveraging LLMs. LangChain's ChatOllama is optimized for conversational AI and complex reasoning tasks, making it ideal for chatbot-like applications: \n",
    "1. In contrast, Agno-agi focuses on modular, flexible architectures for building AI agents, emphasizing tool integration and memory retention \n",
    "2. These differences in design philosophy lead to incompatible interfaces when attempting to use LangChain's LLM within Agno-agi's framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**I found this implementation error:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agno-agi is unable to directly invoke certain functions that are compatible with LangChain's ChatOllama\n",
    "- When these functions are used as tools within Agno-agi's agent workflow, an LLM implementation error occurs. This is likely due to differences in how the two frameworks handle tool registration, API calls, or data formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of the Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- LangChain's LLM operates through a conversational interface designed for maintaining context and coherence in dialogues. Agno-agi, on the other hand, uses a modular architecture tailored for goal-oriented tasks and tool integration. These divergent approaches result in incompatible interfaces, leading to errors when attempting to combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**This can be sovled with my custom implementation**\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specifically:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The LangChain LLM will preprocess the input data and generate responses independently.\n",
    "- These responses will then be passed to Agno-agi's agent workflow via the tool function in Agent.py.\n",
    "- By decoupling the LLM processing from Agno-agi's native tool invocation, we can circumvent the implementation error and ensure seamless integration.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Summary  \n",
    "- This project successfully demonstrated how LangChain can be used to create an AI-powered bridge for Agno-agi in for example the use case finance and data analysis. But, this can be used in any use case as the implementation is just Python classes with Langchain and running Agents with Agno-agi.\n",
    "- There are other functions and classes I have exprimented with where the data has been collected from a csv file or from a PDF to get actionable insights with the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** \n",
    "- This approach improves AI agent efficiency and sets the foundation for AGI development. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s Next?  -- Short Term\n",
    "🚀  I have a few other analysis models such as: insider sentiment analysis, macro economical analysis, geopolitical analysis and options analysis. I am in the near future going to add these analysis model to my Github.\n",
    "🚀 I also have a tool file, where many of my tools are saved, which are used with my other analysis models and these would then also be provided at the same time.\n",
    "🚀  Both Agno-agi and Langchain is constantly evolving and updating, so double check the versions of everything before you run this file. This makes it also possible for me to add some other Agents I have been working on. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s Next?  -- Long Term\n",
    "🚀 Optimize performance using Cython or better function calling inside the Langchain class as these are compute heavy classes  \n",
    "🚀 Expand capabilities with different analysis tasks and other use cases. I have for example a case where I have tested a Machine Learning implementation of these Langchain classes to gain insights tigether with other tools inside the Agent.\n",
    "🚀 Expand datasets and expand the use of different APIs, for example analysing the supply chain or an deeper legal analysis could be an interesting use case \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
