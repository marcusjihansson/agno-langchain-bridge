# More Advanced classes to use in your project 

This is a file for a set of Python classes, which does analysis tasks with an Langchain LLM. 

These tasks are for example: Geopolitical analysis, Macroeconomical analysis, Legal analysis and a 
basic Machine Learning analysis model for stocks and cryptocurrencies. 

My reasoning for picking these is that it shows my skills as an analyst, as all these analysis models shows different ways of analysis. 

As all these classes are Python classes can they be incorporated in the Agent via the tools. 

I have shown how to apply these in the tools.py file. 

Last but not least, at the moment has the data used here not been uploaded to this directory, while how the data collection is made is mentioned in the project files.
