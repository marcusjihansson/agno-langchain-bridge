# More Advanced classes to use in your project 

This is a file for a set of Python classes, which does analysis tasks with an Langchain LLM. 

These tasks are for example: Geopolitical analysis, Macroeconomical analysis, Legal analysis and a 
basic Machine Learning analysis model for stocks and cryptocurrencies. 

My reasoning for picking these classes is that it shows my skills as an analyst, as all these analysis models shows different ways of analysis. 

I have a few more classes to upload, which are for example:
- An advanced sentiment analysis class for insider transactions
- Text processor class, which is a class that picks a report based on a prompt and embeddings. Neat class to test which strategy or report seems impactful in decision making.
- Crypto analysis related classes 

As all these classes are Python classes can they be incorporated in the Agent via the tools as explained in the agno-langchain-bridge

I have shown how to apply these in the tools.py file. 

Last but not least, at the moment has the data used here not been uploaded to this directory, while how the data collection is made is mentioned in the project files. 

If you have any questions or would like more information please reach out to my socials mentioned on the front page.
